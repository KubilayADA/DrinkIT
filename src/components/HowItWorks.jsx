            </p>
            <p className="how-it-works-text">
                1. **Find a Refill Station**: Use our app or website to locate a nearby refill station 
                in partner restaurants, cafes, or bars. We ensure a network of convenient locations to make 
                it easier for you to refill your reusable bottle.
            </p>
            <p className="how-it-works-text">
                2. **Bring Your Reusable Bottle**: Carry your own reusable bottle to the refill station. 
                Not only does this help reduce single-use plastics, but it also keeps your drink cool 
                and refreshing.
            </p>
            <p className="how-it-works-text">
                3. **Choose Your Drink**: Select from a variety of beverages available at the station, 
                including water, juices, and other refreshing options. Our partners offer high-quality, 
                eco-friendly drinks to keep you hydrated.
            </p>
            <p className="how-it-works-text">
                4. **Refill and Enjoy**: Simply refill your bottle at the station and enjoy your drink 
                guilt-free, knowing you’re contributing to a more sustainable future.
            </p>
            <p className="how-it-works-text">
                With our simple and effective process, you can join the movement towards reducing plastic waste 
                and promoting sustainability. Let’s make a change together, one refill at a time!
